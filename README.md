# MediaWiki-Rename-Page
Force Rename a page, &amp; all incoming links it can find

MediaWiki has a built in "Move" tool.  MSSQL had a bunch of issues with this.  I finally got it to work, but wasnt happy with how it did it, so I created my own script.

I wasnt familiar enough with integrating it with MediaWiki, permissions, or as a SPECIAL.  If anyone wants to take that on and integrate it, feel free!

This script is currently just for MSSQL, but sure it can be converted to other db syntax.
